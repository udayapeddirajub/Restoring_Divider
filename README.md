# Restoring_Divider
Design of unsigned 8-bit integer restoring divider. In a restoring divider, the divisor is subtracted from the partial 
remainder, if the resulting partial remainder is negative, the divisor is added back to restore it to an earlier value. In 
this variant, after subtraction, the sign of the resulting partial remainder is checked; if it is negative, the partial 
remainder is not updated in the remainder register.
